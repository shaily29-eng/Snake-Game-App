# Instructions for running the snake game #
This is a simple snake-game application. Here the snake moves based on the arrow pressed. Below are the keys that we need to press for the snake to press:
- "w" to move up
- "d" to move right
- "a" to move left
- "s" to move down
When the snake touches the food its length increases and score increses. For every food a snake eats the score increases by 2. If the snake touches any of the walls then the game expires. 

User can change the colour of the snake from green, blue, and red color options by clicking on "Game Settings" option. Also we can click on "View Scores" option to check all the scores.
