# Instructions for running the snake game #
This is a simple snake-game application. Here the snake moves based on the arrow pressed. Below are the keys that we need to press for the snake to press:
- "w" to move up
- "d" to move right
- "a" to move left
- "s" to move down

When the snake touches the food its length increases and score increses. For every food a snake eats the score increases by 2. If the snake touches any of the walls then the game expires. 

We have created two buttons for the players :
- "View Scores" : Using this button any player can see all the scores that differents players have scored till now.
- "Game Settings" : Using this button any player can change the color of the snake. They get to chose any color from green, blue, and red colour

To run the game we need run Main.java under test folder(package)
